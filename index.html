                <p>Welcome to my personal portfolio page. I desinged this web page to be a quick simple introduction into who I am and what exactly I do. Of course, in reality I am not actually Jiren the great from Dragon Ball Super, but I strive to become as strong as a programmer as he is a fighter.</p>

            <article>
                <p>I am a junior-level or so developer who also happens to be a Linux enthusiast. I started programming seriously around a November of 2022 when I was laid off from my previous job as a loan officer. Prior to the mortgage industry crashing I dabled a lot in linux systems and bash scripting; effectively setting up my own personal servers and VPNs at my homelab. This really became a passion for me during the initial pandemic outbreak when we were all confined to our homes. I fell down a rabbit hole and I never resurfaced, even to this day. </p>
                <p>After discovering my love for Linux and computers during the pandemic, I realized getting into the tech industry would be my dream job. So After I was laid off from my previous job, I enrolled into a coding bootcamp and began my journey.</p>

                <p>I have experience setting up servers, configuring systems in Linux, scripting, and web development (Front end and Back end). My language of choice right now is Java with Spring so I can get my projects up and running in little to no time.</p>

                    <li><span>Artist Webiste: </span>The most recent project I have completed include am Artist Website, which is a full stack website written in Java, HTML, CSS, & JavaScript. It is basically a website that is ready to be deployed and contains a micro-CMS so users can do minor updates to the site without diving into the HTML code. You can check out a live version that I personally use <a href="https://hvssr.net">here</a>. </li>
